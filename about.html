<h2> About </h2>
<p>Dear Self Employed Workers:</p>


<p>I built this website to bring awareness those entering the gig economy. As someone who has worked contract jobs, I know how tempting it is to feel like you only have to pay your federal and state tax and nothing else. But the ever-looming IRS also demands that we pay self employment tax, and the IRS wants us to pay our taxes every quarter to ensure that we don't spend all of it.</p> 

<p>Here's a little bit about me: I earned my J.D. at New England Law | Boston and was the former Online Editor of the <a href="https://www.newenglrev.com/podcasts/3-2022-5v7f4hoolldt2hdheafsbgysxmxh5n"> New England Law Review</a>. I was fortunate to earn first place in the <a href="https://www.bpla.org/page/49"> 2021 Boston Patent Law Association Writing Competition </a> for the best student article related to intellectual property law that (1) contributes to the knowledge respecting intellectual property law; and (2) displays original and creative thought or information not previously published or available. In recognition of my acheivement, the faculty at New England Law | Boston awarded me the Outstanding Scholastic Acheivement Award, given to only four students in a graduating class of 245.</p>
<p> Aside from winning awards, I worked in various legal roles during my time in law school, namely as a legal intern at the Massachusetts Office of Senate Counsel where I researched and drafted reports on the viability of highly relevant policies and legislation.</p>
<p>I've leveraged my impeccable research abilities to provide up-to-date information regarding taxes for the self-employed.</p>
<p>I hope to continue to improve this website to cater more directly to gig workers as time progresses. I know it's tough working these jobs right now. Keep up the noble work.</p>

<p>Best,</p>
