   <h1> 2021 Self Employment Tax Calculator </h2>
   <p>The goal of the self-employment tax calculator is to give those who are entering the freelance economy a rough estimate of the maximum amount they may owe in taxes. The calculator is also useful for those who have a grasp of what their net taxable income will be. The simple interface will allow you to avoid the pesky arithmetic involved in the common tiered tax model. This calculator is only provides a rough estimate and uses the self-employment tax deduction(half of the self employment tax) as well as the standard state and federal deductions to determine your taxable income. </p>
      <p>It's important to note that this website does not claim to give any legal advice. Questions should be referred to a tax professional or lawyer, and estimates should be verified as states vary in the complexity of their deductions. Note that you may also opt for tax credits or itemized deductions. Speak to a professional for more information.</p>
   <h2>Calculating Self-Employment Tax </h2>
   <p>In the US, whether you have a W-2 job or not, if you earn income as an independent contractor or through informal side gigs, the IRS considers you a proprietor of a business, and your business profit is generally subject to federal income tax and self-employment taxes that support Social Security and Medicare.</p>
   <p>When you're starting out in the gig economy, it can come as a shock when you find out that you owe the IRS more than you thought you would. That's because you may have failed to take the self-employment tax into account. In addition to state and federal taxes, someone who qualifies as self-employed and earns $400 or more must pay 15.3% of their adjusted gross income in what's commonly known as a self-employement tax. </p>
      <p>You're essentially responsible for paying the FICA tax like an employer would. The FICA tax consists of Social Security and Medicare. You pay 12.4% on the first 137,700 of earnings(2020) for Social Security and 2.9% on all of your earnings for the Medicare portion. You will pay an additional 0.9% Medicare tax on the amount that your annual income exceeds $200,000 for single filers, $250,000 for married filing jointly, and $125,000 married filing separate. </p>
        
        <p>Those who file a W-2 don't have to worry about this tax; half of it automatically comes out of their paycheck. Luckily for you, the employer portion can be deducted from your net income.</p>
    <p >You calculate your net income by subtracting deductions like business expenses from your total income on a Schedule C form. You can learn more about deductible business expenses by reading the Schedule C instructions and reading the IRS' Publication 535 Business Expenses. You then take the Schedule C net income or profit you calculated and use that to determine your self employment tax. </p>
     <p>Note that you calculate the self employment tax based on 92.5% of your Schedule C profit. Mathmatically, you're pre-determining the deduction of half the self-employment tax by adjusting your net income. Self employment calculations go on Scedule SE, so read the instructions for more information.</p>
      
     <h2>Q&A About The Self-Employment Tax </h2>

   <p class="bold">Q: Why do you have to pay self employment tax? </p>

     <p>Oftentimes, the federal government creates tax policies to generate revenue for programs. In this case, self employment tax ensures that those who do not work (or do not solely work) the normal 9-5, W-2 job pay taxes to fund social security benefits. In other words, the government is not trying to tax your business but is trying to make sure you also contribute to the welfare of the American people.  U.S. v. Cain, S.D.Miss.1953, 113 F.Supp. 304. This obligation is a mandatory one, even if you don’t ever plan to take advantage of social benefits. See Eanes v. C.I.R., U.S.Tax Ct.2000, 2000 WL 1131904.</p>
     
    <p class="bold">Q: Who is considered self-employed? </p>

<p>Section 1401(b) of the Tax Code states that self-employment generally means “. . . any trade or business carried on by . . . an individual.” The phrase “trade or business” is broad. One is engaged in a “trade or business” if they engage with “the activity with continuity and regularity and ... the taxpayer's primary purpose for engaging in the activity must be for income or profit.” Groetzinger, 480 U.S. at 35, 107 S.Ct. 980. With this definition, a full time gambler is engaged in a trade or business. So he or she is self-employed.</p>

<p>Those considered self-employed include but are not limited to independent contractors, see Turnidge v. C.I.R., U.S.Tax Ct.2003, 2003 WL 21321813,  practitioner in a sole proprietorship (if they receive income), partners in a venture (if they receive income), and partners in a limited partnership/ partnership.</p>

<p>However, the law is not that simple. It’s very hard to classify roles into neat little boxes. Take the gig economy, for example. As the gig economy continues to change, it may become difficult to classify who is an employee of the company or an independent contractor. Luckily courts have developed factors for determining who is an independent contractor for the purpose of levying self employment tax. Jones v. C.I.R., 94 T.C.M. (CCH) 230 (Tax 2007).</p>

    <p> These factors are: </p>
<ol>
   <li> the degree of control exercised by the principal </li>
<p>More control by the principal means the worker is likely an employee. The principal does not necessarily have to hover over the worker like a hawk. Gen. Inv. Corp. v. United States, 823 F.2d 337, 342 (9th Cir.1987) For example, workers that set their own hours and clock in and out whenever they want can still be considered employees. This factor is a crucial factor, one that can swing the balance, which makes sense since what separates employees from independent contractors is independence. See Blodgett v. C.I.R., U.S.Tax Ct.2012, 2012 WL 5259054.</p>
 
 <li> which party invests in work facilities used by the individual </li>
<p> If the principal primarily invests in work facilities, then the worker is more likely an employee. But if the worker provides his or her own tools, then it strongly indicates independent contractor status. Breaux & Daigle, Inc. v. United States, 900 F.2d 49, 53 (5th Cir.1990). </p>

<p>This is why companies like Uber, Lyft, and Grubhub don’t provide bikes or vehicles to their workers. Doing so would be a strong showing that the workers are employees which would lead to liabilities. Though for the purpose of tax, the classification of employee versus independent contractor generally effects the worker, not the principal. </p>

 <li> the opportunity of the individual for profit or loss</li>
<p> The ability to make or lose money  based on factors within the control of the worker would lean towards independence. See Jones v. C.I.R., 94 T.C.M. (CCH) 230 (Tax 2007).</p>

 <li> whether the principal can discharge the individual</li>
<p>Work that only allows discharge if the worker doesn’t meet certain specification or rules points to independent contractor status. See Jones v. C.I.R., 94 T.C.M. (CCH) 230 (Tax 2007). Work like this is more contractual in nature. For example, a freelance writer working for a tech company may make an agreement to write three 500-word articles a week for X amount of pay for X amount of weeks. A specific performance of this contract is required where the worker must meet the target of three 500-word articles a week. Not meeting this goal would be grounds for discharge.</p>

<p>On the other hand, independent contractors like Uber drivers, for example, have a more open-ended timeline. Discharge would have to be based on violation of company rules and regulations.</p>

<p>The key here is that an independent contractor cannot be “fired” at will since they are under contract. The excuse for firing would have to be based on quality of service or violation of  guidelines. This is why <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/10/30/uber-driver-firing-policy/?sh=4e1ae8091527">companies like Uber</a> bend over backwards to make sure that they explain why they discharged their workers.</p>

 <li> whether the work is part of the principal's regular business </li>
<p>Work that is part of the principal’s regular business suggests that the person undertaking that work is an employee, but this is just one factor and must be viewed within the context of other factors. For example, a construction business that hires independent contractors is said to have construction as its principal business, with independent contractors who participate in construction. However, other factors like independent investment, permanence, control, etc. determines status.</p> 

<p>Uber provides another great example for this prong. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/14/uber-ride-hailing-app-that-says-it-has-zero-drivers/">Uber claims</a> that the work of transporting people from one place to another is not part of its regular course of business. Rather, it is  “a technology platform for several different types of digital marketplaces.” Uber, perhaps in an tempt to solidify this argument went on to create UberEats.</p>  

 <li> the permanency of the relationship</li>
<p>Transitory work points to independent contractor status, but transients can be employees, including those who work on and off or during specific times of the year. Also, independent contractors can also work for long periods. Herman v. Express Sixty–Minutes Delivery Serv., Inc., 161 F.3d 299, 305 (5th Cir.1998); Avis Rent A Car Sys., Inc. v. United States, 503 F.2d 423, 430 (2d Cir.1974). </p>

 <li> the relationship the parties believed they were creating.</li>

<p>The intended relationship can be viewed objectively by looking at the regular practise of the principal and whether or not the principal issued a Form 1099-MISC. Or whether the worker requested a W-2 or W-4. Jones v. C.I.R., 94 T.C.M. (CCH) 230 (Tax 2007).</p>
    </ol>

 
<p>The above factors are weighed in a balancing test to see whether the facts show that the worker is an employee or independent contractor for the purpose of self-employment tax. </p>

    <p class="bold">Q: What types of income can be taxed under self employment?</p>

<p>The IRS, for the purposes of levying tax, places liability on those who receive net “income” greater than $400. See 1401(b). Net income is determined by subtracting your gross income (total income) from your losses. Importantly, self-employment income, subject to self-employment tax, is determined by  the source of the income, not the taxpayer's status at the time income is realized. 26 U.S.C.A. §§ 1401(a) For example, you can’t take a job as a freelancer, quit the job, receive your last freelance check while working at McDonalds and decide to forgo self employment tax since you are now a W-2 worker. The source of the income must be a “trade or business” as described above. Below is a list of some unconventional  income sources that can be taxed based on case law:</p>

 <ol>
  <li>Income obtained from religious work if Form 4361 is not filed in a timely manner.Gardner v. C.I.R., U.S.Tax Ct.2013, 2013 WL 892963. More about this in the next section.</li>
  <li>Income gained from selling capital like real estate if business earns profit, making it a primary means of generating income. Si Boo, LLC v. C.I.R., U.S.Tax Ct.2015, 2015 WL 468165.</li>
  <li>Income earned from Real Estate commissions. Jondahl v. C.I.R., U.S.Tax Ct.2005, 2005 WL 675444.</li>
  <li>Value-added income earned from cooperatives. Fultz v. C.I.R., U.S.Tax Ct.2005, 2005 WL 555269.</li>
  <li>Income earned running a business entity, including a solo law practice.</li>
  <li>Receiving profits from shares of caught fish with less than 10 crew members. Anderson v. C.I.R., T.C.M. (RIA) 2010-001 (Tax 2010), aff'd, (1st Cir. Mar. 15, 2011).</li>
</ol>

   <p></p>
   <p></p>
<p class="bold"> Q: Who is exempt from the self employment tax? </p>
 
<p>According to section 1402 of the Tax Code, not everyone who would otherwise be considered self employed has to pay self-employment tax. Those who are exempt from self-employment tax include but are not limited to: 1) “a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church or a member of a religious order . . .”, 2) Christian Science practitioners, 3) those who earn money from trading stocks or receiving dividends as long as they are not dealers in stocks and securities, 4)  landlords who earn money from rentals and/or personal property leased with real estate, 5) partners of a firm who earn stipend without working in the course of business, and 6) limited partners who earn distributed shares.</p>
