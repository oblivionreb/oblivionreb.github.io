<h2> About </h2>

<p>Dear Self Employed Workers:</p>

<p>I built this website to make those entering the gig economy realize that there are a lot of taxes that have to be paid once you enter this space. As someone who has worked contract jobs, I know how tempting it is to feel like you only have to pay your federal and state tax and nothing else. But the ever-looming IRS also demands that we pay self employment tax, and the IRS wants us to pay our taxes every quarter to ensure that we don't spend all of it.</p> 

<p>Here's a little bit about me: I am a J.D. Candidate in 2022, an Online Editor of the <a href="https://www.newenglrev.com/"> New England Law Review</a>, and a Legal Assistant at <a href="http://ccervanteslaw.com/"> Cervantes Law </a>.</p>

<p>I hope to continue to improve this website to cater more directly to gig workers as time progresses. I know it's tough working these jobs right now. Keep up the noble work.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Raji Ayinla</p>
